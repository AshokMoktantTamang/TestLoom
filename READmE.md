#TestLoom 
Most exam preparations are poorly carried out because multiple-choice and fill- in-the-
blank practice questions are scattered and inconsistent in availability. TestLoom resolves

this by providing a centralized web-based platform for university students to access,
practice, and discuss questions in a structured and interactive manner. The main aim of
TestLoom is to make the process of examination revision easier and more effective while
studying, as well as to facilitate studying as a collaborative process for students.
